## About me

I am working on developing bi-directional human-centered assistive technology for people with severe disability, VR-based system for healthcare applications, and designing experiment, interviews and questionnaires to evaluate system usability as well as the human factor. I am also interested in integrating sensory (e.g., haptic, vibrotactile, electrotactile) feedback for human motor learning and rehabilitation, and developing multi-sensor system to monitor user’s sleep quality. I am familiar with rapid prototype, embedded system development, and methods for quantitative and qualitative human-machine interaction evaluation.

## Research Projects



### Tongue-controller as hands-free assistive technology (an intraoral module)
![image](To test the basic functionality of computer access, we also tested with 11 subjects for: 
Random command task and maze navigation task(guide cursor from start to end as fast and accurate as possible). 
Maze navigation , average completion time of eleven participants, the result showing That MORA is much better than SNP, as good as TDS
With this design, the tongue movement inside the mouth can be successfully translated into directional commands for navigation tasks.

I have develop an “intraoral module” for tongue-controlled assistive technologies. And tested it’s basic functionality by doing some some computer access tasks.
To test the basic functionality of computer access, we also tested with 11 subjects for: 
- Random command task
- Maze navigation task(guide cursor from start to end as fast and accurate as possible). 
The result of Maze navigation showed that the average completion time of eleven participants was much faster than SNP, as good as TDS.

## Config

Your `_config.yml` could for example look like this:

```yaml
title: "Blog Title"
author: "Blog Author"
description: "My personal blog about ... something"
permalink: /:title/
lang: "en"
excerpt_separator: "\n\n\n"
date_format: "%B %d, %Y"

# Layout

show_excerpts: true        # show article excerpts on the home page
show_frame: true           # adds a gray frame to the site
show_sidebar: false        # show a sidebar instead of the usual header

# Menu

navigation:                # accepts {file, title, url, icon, sidebaricon}
  - {file: "index.html"}
  - {file: "README.md"}

external:                  # shows a footer with social links - for available icons see fontawesome.com/icons
